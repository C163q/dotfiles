--- - **NOTE:** Clang >= 11 is recommended! See [#23](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/23).
--- - If `compile_commands.json` lives in a build directory, you should
---   symlink it to the root of your source tree.
---   ```
---   ln -s /path/to/myproject/build/compile_commands.json /path/to/myproject/
---   ```
--- - clangd relies on a [JSON compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html)
---   specified as compile_commands.json, see https://clangd.llvm.org/installation#compile_commandsjson
